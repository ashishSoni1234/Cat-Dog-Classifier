# Cat-Dog-Classifier
●	Develop a Deep Learning model using Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs) in TensorFlow to classify images of cats and dogs
●	Trained the model on a dataset with multiple convolutional layer, ReLu  and Sigmoid Activation and Max pooling to enhanced feature extraction
●	Achieved an accuracy of 97.15% of training images and 81.22% of validation images
